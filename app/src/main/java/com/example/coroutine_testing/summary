You can test your coroutines with the help of testCoroutine library....

                ** Point that you shouldn't forget...

 Make your coroutines runs on the same thread if you wanna test them...
 this is very easy for testing the coroutine we don't hardcoded the dispatcher instead of this
 we'll inject them into the coroutine class constructor and then pass in coroutine...

For Coroutine we'll use the StandardTestDispatcher and for main Purpose you can use any dispatcher...

so when you use a TestDispatcher in a test coroutines are scheduled but not automatically run..
they need to be explicitly controlled
so you have to pass this this info for running the coroutine

        mainCoroutineRule.testDispatcher.scheduler.advanceUntilIdle()

             *** NOTE
  if you don't explicitly run the coroutine and if you don't use assertions methods , the test might
  pass even if the coroutine logic don't executed at all because:

  Coroutines are not run automatically
  no assertions means no failure: if you don't have any assertions the test won't fail
  because no condition is being checked , in this case the test would simply pass by default...
